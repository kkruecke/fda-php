The cause is that the regex expression does not return all six fields of the rows of the foitext.txt file. It only returns the first five and omits the 6th field,
the text report itself.  Use RegexBuddy to debug the regex expression.  Look into greedy vs non-greedy captures, too. See ~/temp/test.php:
