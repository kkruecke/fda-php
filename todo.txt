1. Are all the functor classes the same. If so, I only need one. 
2. Do I want or need to specify this one functor class in the .xml?
3. How do I specifiy the indcies in the config.xml?
4. Some of the XXXTableInsertIterators don't derive from teh same common base. I think this is an oversight to be corected.
5. Incorporate the update_medwatch logic, now in a separate .php file, into main.php.
