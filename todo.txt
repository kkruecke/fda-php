1. Understand remaining SPL iterator classes, like LimitIterator and FilterIterator, and how they are to be used in the functional programming paragdigm.

2. Model code more after C++ version and copy_if() than prior php version. Make code clear and methods shorter. Add comments to give basic explanation.

3. Add code to take string output returned from SplFileObjectExtended::current and run regex_xxx against it to put results in \Ds\Vector. Consider creating a 
   RegexIterator to do, if it is appropo.

3. Change Registry to read an xml file using SimpleXML

4. Replace any array_search()'es with sort arrays that do binary_search().

5. Incorporate the update_medwatch logic, now in a separate .php file, into main.php.

6. Develop the DeviceCustomFileFilterIterator as the ultimate iterator to use--add Mdr and Text  versions.
