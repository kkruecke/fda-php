1a. Restore config.xml from config.xml.orig


2. The Mdr...Functor seems to go in an infinite loop.

Should I log unsuccessful efforts to locate mdr and text rows in devicefoi.txt--if they have already been filtered as being lasik record? We would, if Mdr and Text functors
    __invoke() returns false, log this.
