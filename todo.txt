1a. Restore config.xml from config.xml.orig

2. There are loads of casts to int that do

     (int) $x

   This probably should be changed to intval($x) because only the first character might be getting converted to an int. Also we might be converting in instances
   where we really shouldn't have to, due to some other error in logic. See these all need to be examined and redesigned.


2. The Mdr...Functor seems to go in an infinite loop.

Should I log unsuccessful efforts to locate mdr and text rows in devicefoi.txt--if they have already been filtered as being lasik record? We would, if Mdr and Text functors
    __invoke() returns false, log this.
