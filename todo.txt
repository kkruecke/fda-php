We are getting a MySQL error:
   Error message is: SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1364 Field 'text_key' doesn't have a default value
 
Recall textfoi's schema has a unique text_key, in addition to the primary key of id:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `textfoi` (
  id int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  mdr_report_key int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,
  text_key int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,
  text_type_code CHAR(1) NOT NULL,
  event_date DATE,
  text_report TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  UNIQUE (text_key)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1 AUTO_INCREMENT=1;

It doesn't appear that the text_key is never really used. It isn't part of medwatch_report. Is it part of the JOIN used to update medwath_report?
My guess is, it can simply be removed, and the code can be rerun/tested.

Change (b)(6) to something else, maybe ______, (omitted).
