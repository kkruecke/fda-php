1a. Restore config.xml from config.xml.orig

1. Maybe we should log unsuccessful efforts to locate mdr and text rows in devicefoi.txt? That is, Mdr and Text functors __invoke() returns false.
   And then log this.

2. Or we could override in the devied class and call this parent method: parent::valide(). In derive clas, if parent::valid() is false, log the result to a file.

AbstractMaudeLaiskInsertIterator { //...
 
  public function valid() : bool
  {
      return $this->valid; // This is the result of $this->stmt->execute()
  }
}
